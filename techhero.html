            <p>My tech hero is Dr. Ayanna Howard. She is a roboticist and the first woman to serve as dean of The Ohio State University College of Engineering, where she advocates for diversity in the field. Her extensive experience in human-robotic systems have made her an important key figure in technology and education while promoting inclusivity.</p>
            <p>
                Dr. Ayanna Howard reflects intersectionality in tech through her work in engineering where it intersects race, gender, and technology. As an African American women, she broke barriers by becoming the first woman to serve as dean of The Ohio State University College of Engineering. Her effort in advocating for diversity and promoting inclusivity reflects her understanding of how different identities shape one's experiences in the tech world.

            <p>My personal tech hero, Marques Brownlee, is a prime example of intersectionality and its influence on the tech industry. As a successful Black content creator in a field historically dominated by white, male voices, Brownlee’s presence challenges implicit biases and broadens the narrative of who can be a tech expert. His success highlights the importance of diverse perspectives in tech, especially in an era where intersectionality—acknowledging how aspects of identity such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status intersect and shape experiences—is crucial.</p>

            <p>Brownlee’s work has not only raised the bar for tech reviews but also provided visibility to Black creators in the tech space, subtly addressing the implicit bias within the industry and its audience. His content reaches a diverse demographic, demonstrating that knowledge and enthusiasm for technology transcend traditional boundaries. The fact that he commands such a vast and loyal following emphasizes how breaking down implicit biases in tech reviews can lead to a more inclusive, enriched community. </p>

   <p> Joan Clarke is my tech hero. She worked during World War 2 as a code breaker while a lot of the other workers were men she was one of the very few women breaking the German code to help win the war. Alan Turing worked with her on breaking code when he assembled a team to do so. </p>
            <p>In relation to intersectionality Joan Clarke being a woman, code breaking was seen more as a man's job. She was one of the few women who were cryptanalysts working during WWII. Being this she faced bias. Intersectionality from our Project #1 is how we look at the world from experiences and not from just one experience but all of ours as a single individual, for Joan Clarke she defied the odds with her mathematical power which was discovered while she was in undergraduate and was invited to join Alan Turing at Bletchley Park. And the rest was history.</p>

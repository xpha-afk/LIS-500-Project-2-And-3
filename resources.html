                <p>Intersectionality is all around us. It is a confusing word that can have many different ways of meaning and multiple ways of expression in this complex world.

                To get a better grasp of intersectionality let's start at the beginning to present you with what we learned in our LIS 500 class. Intersectionality is not just gender, race, and religion, but instead the overall framework of ourselves and how they have an influence on one another shaping us.</p>

                <p>It is to show the way on how multiple different forms of inequality are at a disadvantage. And with these disadvantages comes barriers that other people may not understand. We all deal with inequality differently and many have it worse. We may not see that but intersectionality helps us learn about different kinds of problems.  Reiterating what we presented on our home page by Kimberlé Crenshaw she identifies more than one problem people deal with, not just one on its own when she says “African American girls are six times more likely to be suspended than white girls. That's probably a race and a gender problem.” There is more to the problem: there is a whole history that surrounds it.</p> 

                <p>  <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/20/18542843/intersectionality-conservatism-law-race-gender-discrimination" target="_blank"> The intersectionality wars</a> an article by VOX goes in depth about intersectionality and how those who are conservative
                    fear it and say that “because you’re a minority, you get special standards, special treatment in the eyes of some.” 
                    It also covers Ben Shaprio who is controversial conservative political commentator and was one of the readings about intersectionality was written by
                and where he talks about intersectionality as a "totem poll" depending on who you are more on the
                outside will determine where you are on it.You can access his reading on intersectionality by going to <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/qnesrjodfi80/6BhQkKs1jiG2eYSAqOGgMo/e9da47995fd795f62c525a93dbd6010c/shapiro-what_is_intersectionality-transcript.pdf" target="_blank"> What Is Intersectionality - Ben Shapiro</a></p>

                    <p>Implicit bias is how we see others and associate them with things. This can also be thought of
                        as stereotypes people have developed about certain influences.
                        We took an implicit bias test through Harvard. There are multiple different tests on their site,
                        you can pick anyone you'd like to take. It will test you in different areas to see your insight
                        on topics. If you would like to take one you can click this link to begin. <a

                    When connecting implicit bias to intersectionality they are related concepts in terms of how we relate certain things with other things. For example for the IAT tests it asks you to associate terms with the test you are taking and in relation to intersectionality

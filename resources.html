These can be gender, race, and relgion, but not them alone however its how they are together and have an influence on one another shaping our overal self. It is to show the way on how multiple different forms of inequality are at a dissadvantage. And with these dissadvantages comes barriers that other people may not understand.

                        We took an implicit bias test through Harvard. There are multiple different tests on their site,
                        you can pick anyone you'd like to take. It will test you in different areas to see your insight
                        on topics. If you would like to take one you can click this link to begin. <a

                    When connecting implicit bias to intersectionality they are related concepts in terms of how we relate certain things with other things. For example for the IAT tests it asks you to associate terms with the test you are taking and in relation to intersectionality
